This info corresponds to the binary file: test_hex.bin

The file consists of a binary data stream (i.e. not a native fortran file so you can read it using c code easily)

The first record is a 4 bytes (32bit) integer containing the number of sites N in the lattice

It is followed by N 28bytes records consisting of the following:

* Three 4 bytes (32bit) real numbers that are the site's coordinates
* One 4 bytes (32bit) integer that is the site's state
* One 4 bytes (32bit) real number that is the site's value or invasion potential
* One 4 bytes (32bit) integer that is the site's invasion time
* One 4 bytes (32bit) integer that is the site's trapping time

Site's state flags:
        - state = 4 for invaded sites
        - state = 0 for uninvaded sties
        - state = 2 for trapped sites
        - state = 3 for exit sites

Site's invasion time flag:
        - it is the time at which the site got invaded
        - it has a negative value (-1) for sites that have not been invaded

Site's trapping time flag
        - it is the time at which the site got trapped
        - it has a negative value (-1) for sites that have not been trapped
